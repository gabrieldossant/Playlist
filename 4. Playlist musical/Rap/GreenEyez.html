            Behind these walls there is no pain no gain<br>
            So much drama and it ain't gon' change<br>
            In these last days so decide your ??<br>
            When times get hard homie reach for the sky<br>

            [GREEN EYEZ]<br>
            Up in Delano<br>
            I was stuck up in the D.R<br>
            All I found I was a harder young soldier rollin' with the B car<br>
            Now I'm in this dirty-ass reception center<br>
            And the word on the street is you got to put it down when you're first enter<br>
            So I gots my shank dog, close by side<br>
            Ready to ride cause I ain't ready to die<br>
            Cause in the pen dogs like us get caught up in a twist<br>
            I got the enemies, the Eses and the po-po's in my mix<br>
            Now I'm in this hot power two men cell<br>
            Reminiscin' on what the big homies said back at the County Jail<br>
            Homie get your grind on, homie watch your ass<br>
            Homie watch your stash and if one would run up straight smash<br>
            Cause in the system mark-ass gon' test your nuts<br>
            Even comin' from the shoulders<br>
            Or puttin' something in your guts<br>
            There's two rules to the game: respect and stay with your own<br>
            And never fool step outta the line you got the rights to break his bones<br>
            And any dirty you do lil' homie keep it on the hush<br>
            First one has snitched, first one'll get rushed<br>
            And I ain't got no liquor but I'ma toss up the folders<br>
            So sit back, kick back lil' homie and remember what I told you<br>
            [NIKKI]<br>
            Behind these walls there is no pain no gain<br>
            So much drama and it ain't gon' change<br>
            In these last days so decide your ??<br>
            When times get hard homie reach for the sky<br>

            [GREEN EYEZ]<br>
            About a month in the house<br>
            And now I'm transpackin' to another institution<br>
            With more fightin' and shootin'<br>
            More stabbin' more riots I just can't take it<br>
            Now I'm sendin' moms a letter home just in case I don't make it<br>
            Ain't no guarantees of comin' home, if you do you was blessed<br>
            Cause many homies got shanked or blasted in the chest<br>
            By this time a young rider like me was up in ??<br>
            And I can't count on one hand all the homies that got at me<br>
            By yo I didn't trip<br>
            I held up like a true<br>
            And that's on 92 I had to do what I had to do<br>
            On the yard bangin', hangin'<br>
            Smokin' and drinkin'<br>
            Constantly stressed out<br>
            And always stinkin'<br>
            Cause this here drive you crazy<br>
            And ?? since a hand to keep<br>
            Or maybe some hound dogs just to try to get some sleep<br>
            But peep some day was good but most was hard<br>
            Don't wanna lose time so I'll take my frustration out on the dead bars<br>
            A walk in the track<br>
            Glazin' over the mommas<br>
            Or takin' up ?? into the neck under the bleaches by the water fountains<br>
            Just to maintain<br>
            The system ain't no joke<br>
            Ain't no matter where you locked up had never lose hoe<br>
            About a month in the house<br>
            [NIKKI]<br>
            Behind these walls there is no pain no gain<br>
            So much drama and it ain't gon' change<br>
