            Shit!<br>
Yo!<br>
Juss wakin' up in tha mornnin', gotta thank God<br>
I don't know but today seems kinda odd<br>
No barkin' from the dog, no smog<br>
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog<br>
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out<br>
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out<br>
Hooked it up fo' later as I hit the do'<br>
Thinkin', "Will I live another twenty-fo'?"<br>
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top<br>
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop<br>
Had to stop, at a red light<br>
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight<br>
And everything is alright<br>
I got a beep from Kym, and she can fuck all night<br>
Called up the homies and I'm akksin' y'all<br>
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?<br>
Get me on the court and I'm trouble<br>
Last week fucked around and got a triple-double<br>
Freakin' niggas every way like M.J.<br>
I can't believe, today was a good day<br>
Drove to the pad, and hit the showers<br>
Didn't even get no static from them cowards<br>
'Caus jus' yesterday, dem fools tried ta blast me<br>
Saw da police, and they rolled right past me<br>
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction<br>
As I ran the intersection<br>
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps<br>
What's the 'haps on the craps?<br>
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em!<br>
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas, and watch me break 'em<br>
Wit' tha seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven<br>
Seven, even Back Do' Lil' Joe<br>
I picked up the cash flow<br>
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' "Domino!"<br>
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.<br>
Today was a good day<br>
(Shit!)<br>
Left my nigga's house paid<br>
Picked up a girl been tryynta fuck since the twelth grade<br>
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic<br>
The Lakers beat the Supersonics<br>
I felt on her big fat fanny<br>
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanni<br>
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep<br>
Put her ass to sleep<br>
Woke her up around one<br>
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun<br>
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'<br>
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion<br>
I was glad everything had worked out<br>
Dropped her ass off, and then chirped out<br>
Today was like one of those fly dreams<br>
Didn't even see a Barry flashin' those high beams<br>
No helicopter looking for a murder<br>
Two in tha mornnin', got tha Fat Burger<br>
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp<br>
And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp!"<br>
Drunk as hell, but no thowwin' up<br>
Halfway home, and my pager's still blowwin' up<br>
Today, I diddn't even havvta use my AK<br>
I gotta say it was a good day<br>
(Shhhhit!)<br>
